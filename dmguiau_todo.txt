TODO:
script currently only takes care of assigning global pathnames used by the dmgui_au package
It should eventually implement:
    1) get_all_inp_files
    2) debug all inp file paths (and possibly other values if user chooses)

    possible future additions
    3) most recently read files
    4) most recently edited files
        (stream data from magnetometer; referred to in demag_gui_au as 'go live')
